5          DESCRIPTION:  THIS PROGRAM ILLUSTRATES HOW TO POOL MEPS DATA FILES FROM DIFFERENT YEARS
6                        THE EXAMPLE USED IS POPULATION AGE 26-30 WHO ARE UNINSURED BUT HAVE HIGH INCOME
7          
8          	         DATA FROM 2015 AND 2016 ARE POOLED.
9          
10                       VARIABLES WITH YEAR-SPECIFIC NAMES MUST BE RENAMED BEFORE COMBINING FILES.
11                       IN THIS PROGRAM THE INSURANCE COVERAGE VARIABLES 'INSCOV15' AND 'INSCOV16' ARE RENAMED TO 'INSCOV'.
